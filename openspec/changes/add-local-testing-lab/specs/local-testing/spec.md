## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Local Environment Simulation
The project SHALL provide local tooling to simulate common Kubernetes environments without paid cloud
providers.

#### Scenario: Flux environment
- GIVEN a running local cluster
- WHEN a developer runs `make minikube-setup-flux`
- THEN Flux CRDs and sample HelmRelease and Kustomization resources are applied from `.dev/k8s-samples/`.

#### Scenario: OpenShift environment
- GIVEN a running local cluster
- WHEN a developer runs `make minikube-setup-openshift`
- THEN OpenShift CRDs and sample resources are applied so detection logic can run.

#### Scenario: Cloud context simulation
- GIVEN a running local cluster
- WHEN a developer runs the kubeconfig simulation target
- THEN a context with an EKS, GKE, or AKS style name points to the local cluster.

#### Scenario: Auth error simulation
- GIVEN a running local cluster
- WHEN a developer uses an invalid-token context generated by the helper
- THEN Kubeli surfaces the auth error paths without contacting a cloud provider.

#### Scenario: Scale simulation
- GIVEN a running local cluster
- WHEN a developer runs the scale target with `N`
- THEN N dummy pods are created for performance validation.

### Requirement: Testing Lab Documentation
The project SHALL document how to run the local testing lab and clean it up.

#### Scenario: Developer onboarding
- GIVEN a new contributor
- WHEN they follow the documentation
- THEN they can reproduce each scenario with the listed commands.
