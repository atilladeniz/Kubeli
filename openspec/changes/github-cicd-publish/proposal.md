## Why

The entire release pipeline (`make build-deploy`) runs locally on the developer's macOS machine — including Windows cross-compilation, FTP uploads, changelog generation, and GitHub release creation. This creates a single point of failure, prevents Linux builds entirely, and makes releases non-reproducible. Moving to a full GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline enables all platforms to build in CI (macOS with exported signing certificate, Windows native, Linux native), automated changelog extraction, and a fully repeatable pipeline — reducing the local workflow to just version bump, changelog, commit, and tag push.

## What Changes

- **Full CI/CD publish workflow** that builds all platforms (macOS aarch64 + x86_64, Windows NSIS, Linux AppImage/deb) on GitHub Actions, triggered by `v*` tag push
- **macOS signing + notarization in CI**: Apple Developer certificate exported as GitHub Secret, notarization via App Store Connect API key
- **Automated changelog extraction**: CI extracts changelog from `CHANGELOG.md` in the tagged commit and uses it for GitHub Release notes
- **Dual updater endpoints**: FTP `latest.json` (primary) + GitHub Release `latest.json` (fallback) for redundancy
- **Automated updater manifests**: GitHub-hosted `latest.json` auto-generated by tauri-action, FTP-hosted `latest.json` assembled in finalize job
- **Linux support**: First-class Linux builds (AppImage + deb) with Tauri updater signing
- **Simplified local workflow**: Developer only does version bump → changelog → commit → tag push. No local builds needed.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `ci-publish`: GitHub Actions workflow for full multi-platform Tauri builds (macOS, Windows, Linux), Apple signing/notarization, artifact signing, dual updater manifest generation, FTP deployment, and GitHub Release management
- `release-flow`: End-to-end release orchestration — tag push trigger, CI builds all platforms, changelog extraction, dual updater manifests, FTP deployment, and release publishing

### Modified Capabilities

_None — this change introduces new CI/CD infrastructure without modifying existing application specs._

## Impact

- **New files**: `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (main workflow)
- **Deleted files**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` (disabled, replaced)
- **Modified files**: `Makefile` (simplified release target), `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (dual updater endpoints)
- **GitHub Secrets required**: `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, `APPLE_API_ISSUER`, `APPLE_API_KEY`, `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH`, `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`, `FTP_HOST`, `FTP_USER`, `FTP_PASSWORD`, `DEPLOY_API_FTP_PATH`, `DEPLOY_API_URL`, `DEPLOY_LANDING_FTP_PATH`
- **Dependencies**: `tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0` (GitHub Action), Linux system deps
- **Existing CI**: `ci.yml` (lint/test) unaffected; `sbom.yml` triggered after release publish
