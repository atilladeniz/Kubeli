  Kubeli is a modern, lightweight desktop app for managing Kubernetes clusters.

  Tech stack:
  - Frontend: Vite 7.x, React 19, TypeScript 5.x (strict), Zustand, Tailwind CSS
  - Backend: Tauri 2.9+ (Rust), kube-rs 3.x, Tokio 1.49+
  - Build: npm, Vite, ESLint, Prettier

  Architecture:
  - Feature-based folder structure: src/components/features/
  - Tauri commands in src-tauri/src/commands/ (snake_case)
  - Zustand stores for global and feature-level state
  - IPC via Tauri commands (list_clusters, list_pods, etc.)

  Conventions:
  - TypeScript strict mode, functional components with hooks
  - Named exports for components
  - Rust naming: snake_case functions/variables, PascalCase types
  - Conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:
  - No emojis in commit messages

  Platforms: macOS 10.15+, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), Windows 10 (1809+)

  Performance constraints:
  - Startup < 2s, Memory idle < 150MB, active < 300MB
  - CPU idle < 2%, Bundle < 50MB

  Security: Credentials in OS keychain, TLS 1.2+, code signing required
